# About Me
I am a detail-oriented and organized software developer passionate about designing and creating clean, efficient, and user-focused applications. Proficient in Kotlin, Flutter, and XML, I specialize in building intuitive user interfaces and well-structured, maintainable applications. With a strong focus on crafting tidy, high-quality code, I strive to balance design elegance with technical reliability.

In addition to development, I bring solid experience and growing expertise in quality assurance. My background includes manual testing, regression, usability, and exploratory testing, where I collaborated closely with product managers, developers, and designers to ensure that apps met both functional and user expectations. I contributed to creating test plans, writing test cases, and documenting bugs in tools like JIRA. Notably, I helped catch a misalignment in complex transaction logic early, preventing major issues before release. Recently, I completed an intensive QA bootcamp where I expanded into automation testing using Java (Selenium) and JavaScript (Playwright), and gained practical experience with Katalon Studio—my current tool of choice. I’ve also performed API testing and automated workflows using Postman, and simulated high-load traffic scenarios with JMeter. This blend of real-world practice and structured training has strengthened my ability to ensure application reliability across both manual and automated pipelines.

Driven by a love for learning and problem-solving, I enjoy tackling challenges and delivering innovative solutions that create impactful and user-friendly experiences. I am always open to constructive criticism and suggestions that can help me improve, as I believe feedback is essential for growth. My dedication to excellence and collaboration ensures I contribute meaningfully to any project or team, always aiming to deliver quality results and continuously refine my craft.
